# Arduino-Powered Chicken Coop üêî

Welcome to the delightful Arduino-Powered Chicken Coop project! This joyful and easy-to-use solution will make caring for your chickens a breeze while bringing a smile to your face. This project is perfect for hobbyists and small-scale farmers who want to ensure their chickens receive the best care and living conditions possible. Our Arduino-based system offers an affordable and efficient way to manage your chicken coop, leading to happier chickens and a more enjoyable experience for you.

The `main.cpp` is a compilation of the various seperate files representing the chicken coop. Makes it easier to upload to the Arduino.

## üåà Features

1. **Consistent Light Control**: Brightens your chickens' day by providing a consistent number of hours of light daily, no matter the weather. This promotes their well-being and encourages regular egg-laying patterns.

2. **Automated Door Control**: Automate the opening and closing of the coop door on a predefined schedule, ensuring your chickens can safely roost at night and freely explore during the day.

3. **Humidity Control**: Keep an eye on humidity levels and turns on a small fan when needed, providing a cozy and healthy living environment for your feathered friends.

4. **Food and Water Dispensing**: Using a weight scale, a DC motor, and a peristaltic pump to dispense food and water automatically. This guarantees that your chickens always have access to fresh food and clean water, keeping them happy and content.

5. **Egg Detection, Weighing, and Recording**: Utilizing a break beam sensor and a scale to detect, count, and weigh eggs as they are laid. This fantastic feature allows you to monitor egg production and spot potential issues early.

6. **Temperature Control**: Ensures that your chickens stay comfortable and healthy by maintaining an ideal temperature inside the coop. It controls a heater and air conditioning unit through IoT power relays, making your coop a cozy haven, regardless of the weather outside.

## üí° Contributing

We welcome and appreciate contributions to this project! If you have any bright ideas for improvements or new features, please open an issue to discuss them with our enthusiastic community. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with your changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Potential Issues:
- Humidity fan control operates independently of the temp control. 
- In a worst case, the fan may cause the ac to run longer if it blows cold air outside into a hot environment.

Solution: Integrate the humidity fan control into the temperature control so the temperature is checked before the humidity fan is on, allowing the ac to get a chance to drop the %RH before the humidity fan can turn on if it is hot, preventing them from working against each other.
